A temperature logger for an [[http://www.arduino.cc/][Arduino]] with [[http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=243][data logging shield]] from
[[http://www.adafruit.com][Adafruit]].  Writes temperature data from two different sensors to an SD
card with time stamp.  I am using a National Semiconductor [[http://www.national.com/mpf/LM/LM61.html][LM61]] analog
sensor (part no. LM61BIZ) and a Vishay [[http://www.vishay.com/thermistors/list/product-29049][10 kÎ© thermistor]] (part
no. NTCLE100E3103GB0).

Also includes a Python plotting script which plots both sensors and
fills in bad timestamps with linearly interpolated (or extrapolated) times.

Based on code from [[https://github.com/adafruit/Light-and-Temp-logger]].
